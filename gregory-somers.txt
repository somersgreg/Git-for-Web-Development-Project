Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    You can't put block elements inside inline elements. Formatting. By default, inline elements do not force a new line to begin in the document flow. Block elements, on the other hand, typically cause a line break to occur (although, as usual, this can be changed using CSS).

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document layout flow. Instead, it sits on its own layer separate from everything else.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    inline-block keeps it inline, but allows it to take on block element properties like width and height.

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
    The box model is a series of boxes inside each other that represent different qualities of a presented web element.  At the center is the content. This may be images or text.  Next is padding.  Its a space between the content and the border.  Both padding and border are similar.  They can be thick or thin, or weighted on one side or another. Similar but not the same in usage.  Outer-most is the margin.  This is transparent by default. Essentially the border lies between the margin and padding to give control over the spacing of the border from other elements.

	The fix for box can be inline block or flexbox.
